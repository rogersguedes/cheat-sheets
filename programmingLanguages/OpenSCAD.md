## OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD provides two types of 3D modelling:

1. [Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)
2. extrusion of 2D primitives into 3D space.

Operating Modes:

1. **Preview**: Relatively fast using 3D graphics and the computer's GPU, but is an approximation of the model and can produce artifacts and uses uses [OpenCSG](http://opencsg.org/) and [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL).
2. **Render**: Render generates exact geometry and a fully tessellated mesh and [CGAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGAL) as its geometry engine.

View Modes:

1. **GCAL Surfaces**: The surface view is the initial model view that appears when the model code is first rendered. You can get back to this view by choosing "View >> CGAL Surfaces".
2. **CGAL Grid Only**: The Grid Only view presents only the "scaffolding" beneath the surface, also known as a wireframe. You can get back to this view by choosing "View >> CGAL Grid Only".
3. **OpenCSG**:
